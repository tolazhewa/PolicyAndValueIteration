Welcome to our Optimal Policy Estimation implementation.

This project is attempting at estimating optimal policies for a 4x4 gridworld in which the first (top-left) and the last (bottom-right) are the terminal states.
The goal is to get to the terminal states.

To use this software please take note of the following.

There is an input file that comes with default values which you can change. Here's what the input files values represent:

-----------------------------------------
Probability of moving to next state
Probability of staying at current state
Reward for moving in the UP direction
Reward for moving in the DOWN direction
Reward for moving in the LEFT direction
Reward for moving in the RIGHT direction
-----------------------------------------

Feel free modify and play around with it as you like!

To run Value iteration do the following:
> make via
> ./via.o < input

To run Policy iteration do the following:
> make pia
> ./pia.o < input

To compile both simply:
> make

To clean up the executables:
> make clean

Once again, please ensure the input file has all 6 values and they are numerical values.

Thank you for reading the README :)
